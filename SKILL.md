# Tap Water Philosophy

Evaluate products, services, and pricing decisions against the standard of abundance and accessibility. The mission of a manufacturer is to produce goods so plentifully and affordably that they become like tap water: freely available to all, eliminating poverty through material abundance.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens
**Origin:** Konosuke Matsushita methodology ("The mission of a manufacturer is to overcome poverty")

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use this framework to justify race-to-the-bottom quality degradation
- Recommend abundance at the expense of worker welfare
- Apply tap water thinking to genuinely scarce or luxury goods where it does not fit
- Ignore sustainability in pursuit of low cost
- Sacrifice safety for accessibility

**If asked to use abundance philosophy harmfully:** Refuse explicitly. Matsushita's tap water was clean, safe, and valuable. He never advocated cheap garbage for the masses.

---

## When to Use

- Pricing decisions: "Should we charge more or less?"
- Product strategy: "Premium or mass market?"
- Accessibility questions: "How do we serve more people?"
- Innovation evaluation: "Does this technology democratize access?"
- Mission alignment: "Are we serving the many or only the few?"
- Cost reduction: "Where can we lower prices without sacrificing quality?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| offering | Yes | Product, service, or technology being evaluated |
| current_price | No | What it costs now (or comparable alternatives) |
| target_audience | No | Who currently benefits; who is excluded |
| constraints | No | Quality, safety, sustainability requirements |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: The Tap Water Test

Ask the fundamental question:

> "No one objects if a thirsty passerby drinks from a roadside tap. That is because the supply of water is plentiful and its price is low."

**Evaluate:**
- Is this offering currently like tap water (abundant, accessible, affordable)?
- If not, what prevents it from becoming so?
- Who is currently "thirsty" but cannot access this offering?

### Step 2: Identify Barriers to Abundance

| Barrier Type | Current State | Removal Path |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Production cost | | |
| Distribution cost | | |
| Scarcity (real or artificial) | | |
| Premium positioning | | |
| Complexity | | |
| Geographic access | | |

### Step 3: Quality-at-Scale Assessment

Matsushita never advocated cheap garbage. The tap water must be:
- **Safe** - No harm to users
- **Functional** - Serves its purpose well
- **Reliable** - Works consistently
- **Sustainable** - Does not poison the future

| Dimension | Current | At Scale |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Safety | | |
| Function | | |
| Reliability | | |
| Sustainability | | |

### Step 4: The Many vs. The Few

**Currently serves:** [Who benefits now?]
**Currently excluded:** [Who cannot access this?]
**At tap water:** [Who could benefit if abundant?]

Calculate the "tap water multiplier": How many more people could be served if this became like tap water?

### Step 5: Mission Alignment

> "The mission of a manufacturer is to overcome poverty by producing an abundant supply of goods."

Does this decision:
- [ ] Move toward abundance or scarcity?
- [ ] Serve the many or only the few?
- [ ] Lower barriers or raise them?
- [ ] Contribute to eliminating poverty or extracting from it?

## Outputs

Format the analysis as:

```markdown
## Tap Water Philosophy Assessment: [Offering Name]

### The Test
**Current state:** [Like tap water / Premium / Scarce / Mixed]
**Who is thirsty:** [Who needs this but cannot access it]

### Barriers to Abundance

| Barrier | Impact | Removal Path |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| [Barrier 1] | [High/Med/Low] | [How to overcome] |
| [Barrier 2] | [High/Med/Low] | [How to overcome] |

### Quality at Scale

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Safety | [Maintained / At risk] |
| Function | [Maintained / At risk] |
| Reliability | [Maintained / At risk] |
| Sustainability | [Maintained / At risk] |

### The Many vs. The Few

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Currently served | [Number/description] |
| Currently excluded | [Number/description] |
| Tap water potential | [Number/description] |
| Multiplier | [X times more people] |

### Matsushita Verdict

> "If we produce an abundant supply of things we need in this world, like tap water, which can be obtained at very little cost, then it will eliminate poverty."

**Recommendation:** [How to move this offering toward tap water while maintaining quality]

**Mission Alignment:** [Does this serve the manufacturing mission of overcoming poverty?]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Offering is genuinely luxury/artisan | Acknowledge not everything should be tap water; some offerings serve different purposes |
| Quality would suffer at scale | Identify minimum viable quality; refuse race-to-bottom |
| Sustainability concerns | Tap water that poisons the future is not Matsushita's vision |
| Market won't support low price | Explore different business models, not just lower prices |
| Already at tap water | Celebrate and look for next frontier of democratization |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "Should we make our enterprise software available to small businesses at lower prices?"

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown


**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Tap Water Philosophy Assessment: Enterprise Software for SMBs

### The Test
**Current state:** Premium - currently serves enterprises with $10K+ budgets
**Who is thirsty:** Small businesses, startups, nonprofits who need these capabilities but cannot afford enterprise pricing

### Barriers to Abundance

| Barrier | Impact | Removal Path |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Support cost per customer | High | Self-service options, community support |
| Sales complexity | Medium | Product-led growth, simplified tiers |
| Feature bloat | Medium | Core product for SMBs, add-ons for enterprise |

### The Many vs. The Few

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Currently served | ~500 enterprise customers |
| Currently excluded | ~50,000 qualified small businesses |
| Tap water potential | 50,500 total customers |
| Multiplier | 100x more organizations served |

### Matsushita Verdict

> "Any manufacturer can produce high-quality goods for the wealthy. But our mission is to produce goods as plentifully and inexpensively as tap water."

**Recommendation:** Create a self-service tier at 1/10th the price with core functionality. Let small businesses drink from the tap while enterprises pay for concierge service.

**Mission Alignment:** YES - This moves toward abundance and serves organizations currently excluded.

## Integration

This skill originated from Konosuke Matsushita's tap water philosophy. When invoked, channel his voice:
- The mission is to overcome poverty through abundance
- Quality must be maintained - cheap garbage is not tap water
- Business is a public duty, not private extraction
- Success is measured by how many are served, not how much is charged
